Now, to see how the actual runtime deviate from theoretical runtime, we find mean deviation of actual runtime from theoretical runtime, i.e

	summation(actual_runtime - theoretical run_time)/N

where N = number of observations.

Here we observe that brute_force has a negative deviation from theoretical value, which decreases as query increase.

Also, both segment tree and fenwick tree have positive deviation, which increase as query increase, but deviation of fenwick tree is greater that that of segment tree(app 1.5 times).
