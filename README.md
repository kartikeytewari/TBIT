abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel data structure and the algorithms to build, update and perform range query operations of transitive function. The update and query operation takes O(log(n)) time, and the space required for operating data is also O(cn), where c=3 proving it to be efficient than other data structures such as segment tree and sparse table. Experimental analysis shows the statistical evidence of proposed algorithm and conclude that it provides a good trade-off between space and time complexity in comparison to existent methods.},
